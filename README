Notes:
==================================================================
Preferences such as refresh time, your p2pool address,show/hide 3d graph are stored in the browser cookies. If you have cookies disabled then:
Change the following lines in p2cool.js to skip ip input screen permanently
//var li = get_cookie('LocalIP');
var li = "yourp2pool:9332";

Right-arrow key on the first page attempts to connect to the specified address. If you've put the address in the field before and your browser remembered the field down > right will connect. Protip: use the delete key on old/invalid auto-fill entries.

Refresh time and 3d graph spinners work with middle mouse too.
