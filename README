Notes:
==================================================================
Preferences such as refresh time, your p2pool address,show/hide 3d graph are stored in the browser cookies. If you have cookies disabled then:
Change the following lines in p2cool.js to skip ip input screen permanently
//var li = get_cookie('LocalIP');
var li = "yourp2pool:9332";

Peers are displayed:	outgoing(incoming)
Shares are displayed:	shared/stale

Right-arrow key on the first page attempts to connect to the specified address. If you've put the address in the field before and your browser remembered the field down > right will connect. Protip: use the delete key on old/invalid auto-fill entries.

On the 3d Graph:
-each point of speed is an average of n number of records. n is set with the spinner
-no Z "flattens" to time/speed.

Refresh time and 3d graph spinners work with middle mouse too.

Console is cleared after 200 calls to writeConsole() to reduce memory leakage[if(cbfr>200)]. Other objects might also need cleanup.

jQuery:
-currently the full version 1.7.1 is being used locally on the dashboard
-the online google version and minimal version are commented in dashboard.html, feel free to switch
