//var li = get_cookie('LocalIP');
var li = "yourp2pool:9332";

Peers are displayed:	outgoing(incoming)
Shares are displayed:	shared/stale

Right-arrow key on the first page attempts to connect to the specified address. If you've put the address in the field before and your browser remembered the field down > right will connect. Protip: use the delete key on old/invalid auto-fill entries.

Refresh time and 3d graph spinners work with middle mouse too.

Console is cleared after 200 calls to writeConsole() to reduce memory leakage[if(cbfr>200)]. Other objects might also need cleanup.
